## Introduction
G3NS's ideas lie at the intersection of biology and bio-inspired machine learning, with a focus on C. Elegans. 

**Latest Update:** 4/9/2024 (see below)

## Background
- **C. Elegans Connectome:** This organism's neural network, though intricate, is the most detailed connectome available to researchers. [C. Elegans Connectome edge list modified from the work of Ripoll-Sanchez et al.](https://www.cell.com/neuron/pdf/S0896-6273(23)00756-0.pdf).
- **Understanding Neural Dynamics:** The capability of biological neural connections to not only process and respond to stimuli, but also maintain a power efficient, plastic brain state remains ellusive.
- **Beyond Traditional ANNs:** Conventional Artificial Neural Networks may fall short in mimicking the intricate web of biological neural networks, driving the need for bio-inspired approaches.
- **Broader Implications:** Particularly exciting, is the idead that all mammal connectomes follow similar operational principles, thus the realization of this project could offer clues applicable to more complex neural systems.

## Potential Project Stages
1. **Modeling G3NS:** Crafting a neural network model inspired by the C. Elegans connectome.
2. **Environmental Simulation:** Testing the model's response to sensory inputs within a simulated environment.
3. **Reinforcement Learning Integration:** Employing techniques like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) or Heterogeneous Graph Neural Architecture Search (GHGNAS) to optimize the functions driving the network's learning. 
4. **Neural Pattern Analysis:** In-depth analysis of simulated neural activities. These are tensorboard images from the first time I ran the code.
