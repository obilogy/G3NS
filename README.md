## Introduction
G3NS is a project at the intersection of computational biology and bio-inspired Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML), focusing on the neural network of C. Elegans. 

**Latest Update:** 12/21/2023

## Background
- **C. Elegans Connectome:** This organism's neural network, though intricate, is the most detailed connectome available to researchers. [C. Elegans Connectome edge list modified from the work of Ripoll-Sanchez et al.](https://www.cell.com/neuron/pdf/S0896-6273(23)00756-0.pdf).
- **Understanding Neural Dynamics:** The project addresses the gap in comprehending how biological neural connections not only process and respond to stimuli, but also maintain a power efficient, plastic brain state.
- **Beyond Traditional ANNs:** Conventional Artificial Neural Networks may fall short in mimicking the intricate web of biological neural networks, driving the need for bio-inspired approaches.
- **Broader Implications:** Insights gleaned could offer clues applicable to more complex neural systems.

## Project Stages
1. **Modeling G3NS:** Crafting a neural network model inspired by the C. Elegans connectome.
2. **Environmental Simulation:** Testing the model's response to sensory inputs within a simulated environment.
3. **Reinforcement Learning Integration:** Employing techniques like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) or Heterogeneous Graph Neural Architecture Search (GHGNAS) to optimize the functions driving the network's learning. 
4. **Neural Pattern Analysis:** In-depth analysis of simulated neural activities.

5. **Knowledge Sharing:** Publishing findings to contribute to the bio-inspired AI/ML community.
6. **Comparative Evaluations:** Benchmarking against Brain-Machine Interface models to assess progress and applicability.

## Seeking Collaborators
Please note that I am currently finishing a PhD in Molecular Physiology and Biophysics. This is a side project outside my main PhD project.

I am planning to continue working on this project as I progress from my PhD to a postdoc position. In the mean time, I am looking for collaborators who share a passion for blending computational neuroscience with AI/ML.
